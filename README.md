# Ideology
We start at SemVer "version 0", in which everything may break with every release, but we try not to. As soon as possible, we'll release a version 1.0.0, which we'll try to support as long as possible, but we'll have to decide on a release cadence. We'll probably release a major version _at least_ with every major .NET release.

If there's no documentation and no tests, it doesn't exist. Literally. Something may exist in code, but unless it's documented and at least the happy case is covered, it's not meant to be used.
